      <h2>Welcome to the iSchedule Home page</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>What is iSchedule:</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If you are a student at George Mason University, then you are probably very familiar with the course scheduling process and just how tedious it can be at times. It can take a student anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple of days to schedule their classes. At times it might make you give up on college all together.  Especially when you have scheduled 4 of your classes only to find out that the 5th does not fit anywhere in your schedule. Or when you quit your job because you could not find a suitable schedule.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We have all been through this situation, and it only becomes harder as you go through college.  I thought if we could somehow magically have a list of schedules to choose from, it would make things easier. And that is what this applet is for. I wanted to make scheduling classes as easy and as fast as possible, so that you don't have to worry about it.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This program was designed by a George Mason student for George Mason students. So if you find any mistakes or would like to express your opinion feel free to leave me a <a href="mason.gmu.edu/~mismael/feedback">feedback</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Why the iSchedule:</h3>
      <br>
      <p>The iSchedule was created to help me and other students schedule their courses in an easy way. I ask nothing from the user except for feedback.  The program is free to use and you do not have to download anything.  Everything is online, and I will be adding features as I progress through college.  I hope you enjoy it and that it works for you.
